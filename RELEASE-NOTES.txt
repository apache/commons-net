              Apache Commons Net 3.0 RELEASE NOTES

The Commons Net team is pleased to announce the release of commons-net-3.0
  
Apache Commons Net library contains a collection of network utilities and protocol implementations.
Supported protocols include: Echo, Finger, FTP, NNTP, NTP, POP3(S), SMTP(S), Telnet, Whois

This release fixes many bugs (see below), and adds new functionality:
 - basic support for IMAP and IMAPS
 - support for SMTPS and POP3S


FTP changes:
 - default for lenient future dates is now true, which fixes short date parsing where host clock is ahead of client clock
 - no longer parses every response line twice
 - OS auto-detection can be overriden by defining the property 'org.apache.commons.net.ftp.systemType';
 - or by creating a properties file '/systemType.properties' which provides a mapping from getSystemType() to parser name
 See the Javadoc for FTPClient.initiateListParsing(String parserKey, String pathname).
 - SASL, PLAIN and CRAM-MD5 authentication added
 - added control channel keep-alive for use with misbehaving routers, see FTPClient.setControlKeepAliveTimeout(long controlIdle)


NNTP changes:
 - reworked to use long for article numbers
 - added streaming equivalents for the array methods

Added TrustManagerUtils and KeyManagerUtils classes to simplify setting up trust and key namagers. KeyManagerUtils can be used to provide client certificates.

This release is binary-compatible with 2.2, but there are some minor changes to source compatibility:
 - telnet.TelnetClient#addOptionHandler(TelnetOptionHandler) now additionally throws IOException
 - telnet.TelnetClient#deleteOptionHandler() now additionally throws IOException
 - ftp.FTPSClient ctors no longer throw NoSuchAlgorithmException
 - Redundant CODE_nnn definitions have been removed from FTPReply, SMTPReply and NNTPReply classes
 - Unused String constants KEYSTORE_ALGORITHM, PROVIDER, STORE_TYPE, TRUSTSTORE_ALGORITHM removed from FTPSClient

All users are recommended to upgrade.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o NET-333:  Added basic IMAP/IMAPS implementation. Thanks to Bogdan Drozdowski. 
o NET-326:  A KeyManager is required when the protection level is set to 'P' with FTPSClient on active mode.
            Added KeyManagerUtils class to simplify provision of client certificates. 
o NET-273:  FEAT response parsing. Added FTPClient methods: boolean hasFeature(feature [,option]),
            String fetaureValue(feature), String[] featureValues(feature) 
o NET-379:  FTPClient - support for processing arbitrary commands that only use the control channel 
o NET-378:  FTP listing should support MLST and MLSD. 
o NET-372:  FTPSClient: java.security.cert.CertificateException: No X509TrustManager implementation available if trustManager == null 
o NET-371:  Create TrustManagerFactory to provide custom TrustManagers. 
o NET-327:  "Unconnected sockets not implemented" when using FTPSClient
            Added disconnect() override which resets the socket factories to their defaults Thanks to Bogdan Drozdowski. 
o NET-350:  "java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe" when calling "TelnetClient.sendAYT()"

Fixed Bugs:
o NET-404:  FTPSSocketFactory does not override createSocket(); causes java.net.SocketException: Unconnected sockets not implemented. 
o NET-399:  ftp data connection does not use connectTimeout. Thanks to Noah Levitt. 
o NET-402:  IMAP, NNTP, POP3 and SMTP classes uses BufferedReader for control channel, which does not follow the standard.
            Changed reader to CRLFLineReader. 
o NET-401:  FTP class uses BufferedReader for control channel, which does not follow the standard.
            Changed reader to CRLFLineReader. 
o NET-268:  Better handling of CIDR/31 and CIDR/32 where isInclusive = false.
            Return 0 for address count, and 0.0.0.0 for each of the addresses 
o NET-389:  Unix parser should ignore "total nnn" lines. 
o NET-367:  ntp.TimeStamp uses incorrect lazy initialisation of static fields simpleFormatter and utcFormatter. 
o NET-388:  VMSVersioningFTPEntryParser#preParse should not call super.preParse(). 
o NET-362:  TelnetInputStream has various threading bugs. 
o NET-89:  TelnetClient use of FromNetASCIIInputStream and ToNetASCIIOutputStream breaks binary mode.
            See also NET-387. 
o NET-354:  FTPSClient not properly supporting CCC and PROT P. Thanks to Leif John Korshavn. 
o NET-365:  FTPClient.listFiles() does not work properly, if remote server speaks German.
            Match non-space{3} instead of A-Za-z{3} 
o NET-366:  FTPClientConfig: setServerLanguageCode and setShortMonthNames do not work.
            Ensure that config is passed to all parsers that can use it. 
o NET-276:  NNTPClient has problems with group listings for large groups. 
o NET-185:  Possible NPE in Threader.java 
o NET-364:  nntp.Article is very inefficient and incorrect.

o NET-348:  Queue is full TelnetInputStream. 
o NET-345:  Telnet client: not properly handling IAC bytes within subnegotiation messages:
            - failing to double IACs on output
            - failing to de-double IACs in input Thanks to Archie Cobbs. 
o NET-270:  Incorrect error handling in method initiateListParsing of FTPClient. 
o NET-258:  Implement A Keepalive Mechanism. Control channel keepalive implemented for the following methods:

o NET-355:  examples.nntp.NNTPUtils does not compile 

Changes:
o NET-407:  Change lenientFutureDates to default to true.
            This means short dates will be parsed as the current year when the host clock is up to 1 day ahead of the client clock. 
o NET-400:  Option to override SSL negotiation. Make FTPSClient#execAuth() and FTPSClient#sslNegotiation() protected Thanks to David Kocher.

            Catch blocks removed, and throws clauses added to allow caller to more easily detect and recover. 
o NET-397:  FTPSClient does not handle AUTH or ADAT and only partially handles PBSZ. FTPSCommand should be deprecated. Thanks to Bogdan Drozdowski. 
o NET-395:  Move ProtocolCommandSupport to SocketClient. 
o NET-393:  Should the sendCommandWithID() methods be public?
            Made methods private, and deleted currently unused ones. 
o NET-394:  Are the sendUntaggedCommand() methods needed?
            Renamed the method as sendData(), as it's not a command. 
o NET-392:  Use enum for IMAPCommand. 
o NET-381:  Parsing is inefficient, as it parses everything twice. 
o NET-385:  FTP does not apply timeout to initial responses. 
o NET-384:  KeyManagerUtils - the KeyManager is not efficient.

o NET-377:  NLST does not take notice of HiddenFiles setting. 
o NET-373:  NNTP Listgroups not working - broken server implementation. 
o NET-375:  DotTerminatedMessageReader should extend BufferedReader, rather than Reader. 
o NET-374:  ParserInitializationException doesn't use standard JDK exception chaining 
o NET-368:  Threader.thread should accept an Iterable rather than a List. 

Removed:
o NET-369:  Article.addHeaderField() is currently write-only - there is no way to retrieve the headers - is it needed?
            Method was removed, along with the field. 
o           Removed deprecated unused fields from FTPSClient:
            - KEYSTORE_ALGORITHM, PROVIDER, STORE_TYPE, TRUSTSTORE_ALGORITHM 
o NET-330:  The method VMSFTPEntryParser.parseFileList(InputStream listStream) should not be present.
