      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implement Extensible date format handling for FTPClient (DONE)</li>
          <li>Scan the bug list</li>
        </ul>

    <section name="Wishlist">
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add more unit tests, and implement mock servers for testing</li>
          <li>
            Convert code to specified coding standards.  Checkstyle report provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clean out any classes that don't belong in this project.  Probably classes from
            org.apache.commons.net.util and org.apache.commons.net.io could be moved to their corresponding commons projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divorce FTPClient from TelnetClient, getting rid of the 
            TelnetClient threads which cause problems on some platforms 
            (e.g., MacOS).
          </li>
          <li>
            Parse the client/server interactions without creating so many 
            strings. Many operations are slow because of this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add ESMTP and more extended NNTP commands.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make NNTPClient.listNewsgroups() and NNTPClient.listNewNews() 
            more efficient. Don't preparse into lots of little objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            TLS for FTP
          </li>
        </ul>
