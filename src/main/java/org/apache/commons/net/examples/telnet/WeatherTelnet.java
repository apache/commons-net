/***
 * This is an example of a trivial use of the TelnetClient class.
 * It connects to the weather server at the University of Michigan,
 * um-weather.sprl.umich.edu port 3000, and allows the user to interact
 * with the server via standard input.  You could use this example to
 * connect to any telnet server, but it is obviously not general purpose
 * because it reads from standard input a line at a time, making it
 * inconvenient for use with a remote interactive shell.  The TelnetClient
 * class used by itself is mostly intended for automating access to telnet
 * resources rather than interactive use.
