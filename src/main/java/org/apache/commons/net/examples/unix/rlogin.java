/***
 * This is an example program demonstrating how to use the RLoginClient
 * class. This program connects to an rlogin daemon and begins to
 * interactively read input from stdin (this will be line buffered on most
 * systems, so don't expect character at a time interactivity), passing it
 * to the remote login process and writing the remote stdout and stderr
 * to local stdout.  If you don't have .rhosts or hosts.equiv files set up,
 * the rlogin daemon will prompt you for a password.
 * <p>
 * On Unix systems you will not be able to use the rshell capability
 * unless the process runs as root since only root can bind port addresses
 * lower than 1024.
 * <p>
 * JVM's using green threads will likely have problems if the rlogin daemon
 * requests a password.  This program is merely a demonstration and is
 * not suitable for use as an application, especially given that it relies
 * on line buffered input from System.in.  The best way to run this example
 * is probably from a Win95 dos box into a Unix host.
 * <p>
 * Example: java rlogin myhost localusername remoteusername vt100
 * <p>
 * Usage: rlogin <hostname> <localuser> <remoteuser> <terminal>
