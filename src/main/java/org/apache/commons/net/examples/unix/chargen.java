/***
 * This is an example program demonstrating how to use the CharGenTCPClient
 * and CharGenUDPClient classes.  This program connects to the default
 * chargen service port of a specified server, then reads 100 lines from
 * of generated output, writing each line to standard output, and then
 * closes the connection.  The UDP invocation of the program sends 50
 * datagrams, printing the reply to each.
 * The default is to use the TCP port.  Use the -udp flag to use the UDP
 * port.
 * <p>
 * Usage: chargen [-udp] <hostname>
