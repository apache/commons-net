/**
 * DotTerminatedMessageReader is a class used to read messages from a
 * server that are terminated by a single dot followed by a
 * &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;
 * sequence and with double dots appearing at the begining of lines which
 * do not signal end of message yet start with a dot.  Various Internet
 * protocols such as NNTP and POP3 produce messages of this type.
 * <p>
 * This class handles stripping of the duplicate period at the beginning
 * of lines starting with a period, and ensures you cannot read past the end of the message.
 * <p>
 * Note: versions since 3.0 extend BufferedReader rather than Reader,
 * and no longer change the CRLF into the local EOL. Also only DOT CR LF
 * acts as EOF.
