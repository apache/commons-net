 * DotTerminatedMessageWriter is a class used to write messages to a

 * &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;
 * sequence and with double dots appearing at the begining of lines which
 * do not signal end of message yet start with a dot.  Various Internet
 * protocols such as NNTP and POP3 produce messages of this type.
 * <p>
 * This class handles the doubling of line-starting periods,
 * converts single linefeeds to NETASCII newlines, and on closing
 * will send the final message terminator dot and NETASCII newline
 * sequence.
