/***
 * FTP provides the basic the functionality necessary to implement your
 * own FTP client.  It extends org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient since
 * extending TelnetClient was causing unwanted behavior (like connections
 * that did not time out properly).
 * <p>
 * To derive the full benefits of the FTP class requires some knowledge
 * of the FTP protocol defined in RFC 959.  However, there is no reason
 * why you should have to use the FTP class.  The
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPClient} class,
 * derived from FTP,
 * implements all the functionality required of an FTP client.  The
 * FTP class is made public to provide access to various FTP constants
 * and to make it easier for adventurous programmers (or those with
 * special needs) to interact with the FTP protocol and implement their
 * own clients.  A set of methods with names corresponding to the FTP
 * command names are provided to facilitate this interaction.
 * <p>
 * You should keep in mind that the FTP server may choose to prematurely
 * close a connection if the client has been idle for longer than a
 * given time period (usually 900 seconds).  The FTP class will detect a
 * premature FTP server connection closing when it receives a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPReply#SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE FTPReply.SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE }
 *  response to a command.
 * When that occurs, the FTP class method encountering that reply will throw
 * an {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPConnectionClosedException}
 * .  <code>FTPConectionClosedException</code>
 * is a subclass of <code> IOException </code> and therefore need not be
 * caught separately, but if you are going to catch it separately, its
 * catch block must appear before the more general <code> IOException </code>
 * catch block.  When you encounter an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPConnectionClosedException}
 * , you must disconnect the connection with
 * {@link #disconnect  disconnect() } to properly clean up the
 * system resources used by FTP.  Before disconnecting, you may check the
 * last reply code and text with
 * {@link #getReplyCode  getReplyCode },
 * {@link #getReplyString  getReplyString },
 * and {@link #getReplyStrings  getReplyStrings}.
 * You may avoid server disconnections while the client is idle by
 * periodicaly sending NOOP commands to the server.
 * <p>
 * Rather than list it separately for each method, we mention here that
 * every method communicating with the server and throwing an IOException
 * can also throw a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.MalformedServerReplyException}
 * , which is a subclass
 * of IOException.  A MalformedServerReplyException will be thrown when
 * the reply received from the server deviates enough from the protocol
 * specification that it cannot be interpreted in a useful manner despite
 * attempts to be as lenient as possible.
